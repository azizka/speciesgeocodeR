We established the Brassica Resource Bank (BRB) in order to supply basic plant materials for structural/functional genomics and breeding of Brassica. BRB has served various Brassica species, especially, doubled haploid and recombinant inbred lines, and DNA stocks including BAC libraries and cDNA libraries. BRB has collected specific-Brassica cultivars as well as subspecies from international plant resource centers. Moreover, all germplasms of BRB have been propagated and maintained. Currently, BRB has collected 9,591 accessions for Brassica species, 91,446 clones for cDNA libraries, and 277,440 clones for BAC libraries, and 1,398 genetic markers. BRB has served more than 621,345 clones, 280 genetic markers and 6,210 lines to researchers in 10 countries since 2003.

The first natural history collections accessioned into the Museum were those of Manuel Martorell, brother of the founder. The institution acquired its definitive 'naturalist' character within a few years of its founding when the archeology collections were transferred elsewhere. In second decade of the 20th century, the collections housed at the Museum of Catalonia (as it was called) were divided. As a result of this redistribution, the Martorell Museum acquired the geology holdings and the zoology collections were housed in the building known as Three Dragons Castle. Over the years, the Museum has added other collections, assembled through the efforts of individuals, collection campaigns, research, and occasional acquisitions. All of this has led to the impressive holdings that today provide material for research and public exhibitions.","Passeig Picasso S/N","","","Barcelona","","08003","Spain","","","","","","","Spain","Francesc Uribe","","","","","","",""

The research activities reflect the diversity of the eight scientific departments and their collections, which cover most group of invertebrates and vertebrates, extant and fossils, archeozoology, mineralogy and geology. With very active fieldwork schedule on most continents, research at the museum includes comprehensive taxonomic revisions, new taxa descriptions, annotated faunistic lists, phylogeny and phylogeography studies (both morphological and molecular based). These researches are crucial for the understanding and protection of the biodiversity, in Switzerland and world while. Several projects are financed yearly by national or international funds, including the Swiss National Science Foundation, Switzerland's foremost institution in the promotion of scientific research. Meetings and congress are often organized at the museum, and students from several universities receive a complete scientific training in systematic and taxonomy at the museum, based on collection studies and molecular techniques conducted at the museum's own laboratory. Based on its long tradition on the study of bats in Switzerland, the museum houses the Swiss Bat Center which coordinates the protection and study of bats in West Switzerland and holds a large bibliographic database. On top of their scientific activities, all researchers at the museum are involved periodically in the conceptions and renovations of permanent and temporary exhibits.","","","","","","","","Route de Malagnou 1","","","Geneva","","1208","Switzerland","Danielle Decrouez","","","","","","",""

Since 1879 the Herbarium of the Department of Botany of the University of Coimbra, Portugal (COI), has owned the Herbarium of the german (Saxonian) Henrich Moritz Willkomm, Professor at Prague University and a specialist on the flora of the Iberian Peninsula. This collection was bought to Willkomm and contains vascular and non-vascular plants of the Mediterranean area and the Macaronesian Islands and includes c. 10.000 species and over 30.000 specimens. The specimens were collected by Willkomm himself and other relevant botanical collectors of the time e.g., Bourgeau, Orphanides, Sieber, Lange, Loscos, Boissier, Reuter, Lagasca, Cavanilles. It was the basis for Willkomm and Lange's Prodromus Florae Hispanicae (1861-1880), the first comprehensive Flora of most of the Iberian Peninsula - only now being superseded by the Flora iberica (Castroviejo et al., 1986-, Madrid) - and contains many type specimens of Iberian taxa. Not all Willkomm specimens are at COI and some are scattered in other institutes. But this is by far the largest assemblage of his material and he regarded it as his core collection which, as a whole he sold to Júlio Henriques, the founder of COI.

The collection is the mainstay of graduate training in systematic entomology at the University of Minnesota.","1980 Folwell Ave., 219 Hodson Hall","Department of Entomology","University of Minnesota","St. Paul","MN","55108","USA","1980 Folwell Ave., 219 Hodson Hall","Department of Entomology","University of Minnesota","St. Paul","MN","55108","USA","Robin Elizabeth Thomson","","","","","","",""

The ATH boasts state-of-the-art facilities and infrastructure for specimen processing and curation, photography, pest and climate control, and field, herbarium and laboratory research. The main activity is management of the more than 160,000 plant specimens that comprise the CNS collection, a merger of the collections (and staff) of the Australian National Herbarium Atherton (QRS), the Queensland Herbarium Mareeba (MBA) and part of the JCU Herbarium collection (JCT) to form an unsurpassed representative collection of north Queensland's flora. Research at the Australian Tropical Herbarium covers a range of topics including tropical plant and fungal taxonomy and evolution, ethnobotany, ecology, climate change studies, development of identification products, agroforestry and regional ecosystem mapping.

The Elizabeth Teter Lunn Herbarium is home to more than 5,000 plant specimens dating primarily from the turn of the twentieth century, with some being collected, purportedly, as early as 1848. Between the years 1895 and 1897. M.C. Jensen, a student and botanist, collected more than 80 specimens within the city of Lake Forest, IL, and added these to the College's collection.  At present, student Victoria Jones is in the process of writing a proposal for Lake Forest College to pay more attention to the collection and thus salvage this one-of-a-kind herbarium. This proposal reflects Victoria's senior-thesis topic and all of the tedious curatorial work she has committed to for the past three years. Victoria is currently working alongside Gerould Wilhelm, the foremost vascular plant botanist of the Chicago Region, to observe truth and beauty in each specimen of the ETL Herbarium. The outcome will be Gerould Wilhelm's and Laura Rericha's brand new book, Flora of the Chicago Region. This book will update Swink and Wilhelm's Plants of the Chicago Region (1994).","555 North Sheridan Road","","","Lake Forest","Illinois","60045","USA","555 North Sheridan Road","","","Lake Forest","Illinois","60045","USA","Victoria Anne Jones","","1895","The majority of the collection contains specimens from Illinois Beach State Park (IBSP) collected by Elizabeth Teter Lunn (professor at Lake Forest College) between the 1950s and mid-1970s. Lunn's interest in collecting from IBSP was based on an earlier study tallying the park's flora during the 1900s. The result was the publication of her guidebook, &quot;Plants of the Illinois Dunesland,&quot; completed in 1982 and published by The Illinois Dunesland Preservation Society.","","5000","",""

Many of the specimens represent species that are rare in the state or were collected from rare or unusual habitats.  The goals of the collection are 1) to provide a reference collection for work performed by Natural Heritage Commission staff and their conservation partners, 2) to house voucher specimens for rare plant records in the database of the Arkansas Natural Heritage Program, and 3) to voucher plants of ecologically sensitive or otherwise significant lands, including those contained within the State's System of Natural Areas.

Its various activities present the nature and the characteristics of the canton Grisons to the broad public. A major aspect of the activities is documenting the nature of the Grisons and its changes. The rich collections and its own research suit this purpose.  Collections  The collections are the core of the museum and indispensable for science. Most objects of the collections come from Grisons. The oldest collections are 200 years old. Others were built up a short time ago and have been supplemented continuously. Especially worth mentioning are the collections from the Swiss National Park and the one of mammals.  Botany: The collection of vascular plants is extensive. The so-called &amp;ldquo;Herbarium Raeticum&amp;rdquo; covers examples of vascular plants collected in Graub&amp;uuml;nden within the last 200 years. World-famous Josias Braun-Blanquet (1884-1980), a pioneer of plant ecology, had a herbarium of his own in his parental home in Chur. This herbarium is at the Natural History Museum of the Grisons, while his other herbariums are stored at the University of Montpellier. The oldest herbarium of the Museum was collected at the beginning of the 19th century by the B&amp;uuml;ndner pastor Luzius Pool.  Zoology: Since the foundation of the museum mammals have been continuously collected. And since 1970 small mammals (rodents, insectivores, small carnivores) have been systematically sampled. This collection is one of the most extensive in the whole area of the Alps. Various collections from the Swiss National Park as well as the collection of butterflies by Thomann and the collection of snails by Wolf are scientifically significant. Recent collections are those of wild bees and butterflies.  Geology: The geological collections include many special pieces collected by well-known B&amp;uuml;ndner geologists. The rock collection of big tunnel constructions in Grisons is outstanding. On display there are fossils from the region of the Swiss National Park, the region of Piz Aela (fish saurian) and relicts of fish saurian from the Ducan area near Davos. Fragments of cave bear bones &amp;ndash; between 50&amp;#39;000 and 100&amp;#39;000 years old &amp;ndash; were found in the caves of Sulzfluh near St. Ant&amp;ouml;nien.  &amp;nbsp;","info@bnm.gr.ch","ueli.rehsteiner@bnm.gr.ch","sabrina.schnurrenberger@bnm.gr.ch","CH-7000 Chur","Graubünden","7000","Switzerland","Masanserstrasse 31","","","CHUR","","","Switzerland","Ueli Rehsteiner","CH-024","1850","Switzerland, especially canton of Graubünden.","","","","Jahresbericht der Naturforschenden Gesellschaft Graubündens."

With almost 10,000 specimens, the Clark Herbarium includes dry botanical mounts, most of which were collected from the Riverside region and surrounding counties by J. C. Roos and other botanists between 1920 and 1990. A small collection of lichens and fungi was assembled during the 1930s by Edmund C. Jaeger, and was later donated to the Museum during his tenure as Curator of Plants.

We also have smaller collections of mammals, insects, and plants.  The bird collection consists of approximately 67,000 study skins, 9,000 skeletons, and 36,000 clutches of eggs. We also maintain a small tissue collection containing samples from eastern North American taxa. &amp;nbsp;The collection, worldwide in scope, has especially strong collections of Philippine and Central and South American birds. The holdings represent about 4,000 bird species. About 140 taxa are in the type collection.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  The Museum&amp;#39;s&amp;nbsp;mollusk collection consists of more than 2 million specimens, making it one of the top twelve in the United States. The 220,000 cataloged lots represent more than 18,000 species. Worldwide in scope and covering all seven living classes of mollusks, our holdings comprise marine Gastropoda (50%), land and freshwater Gastropoda (25%), marine Bivalvia (15%), and freshwater Bivalvia (5%). The Museum&amp;#39;s mollusk collection is primarily dry shells, with some alcohol preserved cephalopod specimens.&amp;nbsp; Most specimens are recent; however there is some&amp;nbsp;Cenozoic fossil material. Our type collection contains more than 1,200 lots.&amp;nbsp;  The mammal collection consists of approximately 6,000 specimens (skins, skulls, &amp;amp; skeletons). About half of the collection is Philippine bats and rodents, most collected by D.S. Rabor; the remaining half is North American mammals.&amp;nbsp;  The insect collection contains approximately 1,500 specimens primarily from eastern North America.&amp;nbsp;  The herbarium contains nearly 400 specimens, primarily from the eastern United States and mostly collected since 1980.","P.O.

The largest of the collections, in terms of numbers, is the extensive insect collection, which accounts for approximately half of all specimens.  The collections date back to 1792 and include material from the museums of the Royal Dublin Society (1792-1877), Royal Irish Academy (1798-1890) and Museum of Irish Industry (1845-1867).","Merrion Street","","","Dublin","","","Ireland","","","","","","","","Nigel Monaghan","","","","","","",""

They include representatives of all major groups with strengths in reptiles and amphibians, fish, insects, corals, crustaceans and molluscs, with smaller collections of mammals and birds. The majority of specimens are from Trinidad &amp;amp; Tobago but there are many from the surrounding region. The core of the collection came from the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture established in the 1920s. This evolved into the University of the West Indies. Other local collections have been merged with the UWIZM, these include the Caribbean Epidemiology Centre (CAREC), The Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International (CABI), and the zoological specimens from the National Museum of Trinidad &amp;amp; Tobago (NMTT).&amp;nbsp;  In many older publications the collection is known as the Land Arthropod Collection of the University of the West Indies.&amp;nbsp;","The University of the West Indies Zoology Museum","Department of Life Sciences","The University of The West Indies","St. Augustine","Not Applicable","Not Applicable","Trinidad and Tobago","","","","","","","","Mike G.

The wet, alcohol-preserved collection is exceptionally rich, with over 1,000,000 specimens, nearly half of which are Trichoptera, or caddisflies, resulting from 40 years of work by Director Emeritus Dr. John Morse. Another highly noteworthy subcollection is the black fly (Simuliidae) collection maintained by Dr. Peter Adler, comprising &amp;gt;10,000 specimens, both dry and wet-preserved. The pinned, dry collection comprises about 300,000 specimens, with strong representation of southeastern U.S. species of all the major orders.","E-249 Poole Agricultural Center","","","Clemson","SC","29634-0310","USA","312 and 314 Long Hall","","","Clemson","SC","29634-0310","USA","Michael S.

The first specimens were transferred from the California State Insectary at Sacramento when Harry Smith joined the Faculty in 1923. Other sizable personal collections were added by P.H. Timberlake in 1924 and L.D. Anderson in 1948, and the G.P. McKenzie collection of North American Coleoptera was purchased in 1965. The division of entomology museum was formalized by E.I. Schlinger in 1962. S.I. Frommer and J.C. Hall joined the effort in 1964. Frommer developed the collection in what was then the Division of Economic Entomology while Hall curated the collections in what was then the Division of Biological Control. For many years the UCR Entomological Museum went under the descriptive yet unofficial name that Frommer had coined for it -- The UCR Entomological Teaching and Research Collection.  On March 30, 1994 a new building for UCR&amp;#39;s large collection of insects and related arthropods was dedicated and given an official name -- the Entomology Research Museum. The lower of two floors in the building houses the collection and provides offices, space for curating and research for its Director, Dr. Serguei V. Triapitsyn, its senior museum scientist, Dr. Doug Yanega, and visiting scientists as well as students. There is a preparations room, a small library/lab room, and a large room for teaching, special seminars, and other events sponsored by the Department of Entomology.  Among the many strengths of UCR&amp;#39;s collection are its holdings of native bees and parasitic Hymenoptera, as well as the families Asilidae, Bombyliidae, and Sciomyzidae (Diptera), Coccinellidae, Staphylinidae, and Meloidae (Coleoptera), Aphididae and Miridae (Hemiptera), and the order Thysanoptera. Of particular interest is its large collection of immature insects (the work of the late L.D. Anderson), and an enormous voucher collection from a 10-year faunistic survey of the Boyd Deep Canyon Research Center, a substantial portion of which is now databased. Our holdings, of roughly 3 million specimens (placing it among the 25 largest insect collections in North America), include primarily terrestrial insects from Southern California and Arizona, with strong representations of Mexican insects (primarily Baja California and Sonora), and various other parts of the world including Thailand, Brazil, Honduras, Russia, India, and Australia.","Department of Entomology, University of California","","","Riverside","CA","92521","USA","","","","","","","USA","Doug Yanega","","","","","","",""

Purpose of the Bank  Its main purpose is to enhance plant taxonomic and evolutionary studies by providing:    	  		Permanent storage of Plant DNA material  	  		Documentation of each sample in a database online  	  		DNA aliquots. This is subjected to the recipient&amp;#39;s compliance with the letter and spirit of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).    3. Policies  Policies have been developed in line with the UN Convention for Biological Diversity. Samples will not be made available for bio-prospecting endeavors or any other commercial application.  4. Available taxa in the DNA Bank  The UJ DNA Bank currently contains over 12 000 samples either extracted (Doyle and Doyle, 1987) or as desiccated leaves in silica bags. Each sample is vouchered (JRAU or BNRH).","African Centre for DNA Barcoding (ACDB)","Department of Botany and Plant Biotechnology","University of Johannesburg","Johannesburg","Gauteng","2006","South Africa","","","","","","","","Michelle van der bank","","","","","","",""
