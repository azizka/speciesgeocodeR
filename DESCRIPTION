Description: Facilitating the use of large scale species occurrence records in biogeographic analyses. Automated cleaning of geographic occurrence records, range size estimation, visualization of richness patterns and classifying occurrence data into discrete areas for historical biogeography. Data cleaning of species occurrence records by automated flagging of problems common to biodiversity data from biological collections. Range shape and range size estimation of species from geographic occurrences records based on convex hulls, area of occupancy, WWF ecoregions and various distance measures. Preparation of species occurrences and distribution data for the use in phylogenetic analyses. SpeciesgeocodeR is especially suited for biogeographical and ecological questions on large datasets. The package includes the easy creation of summary-tables and -graphs and geographical maps. See \url{https://github.com/azizka/speciesgeocodeR/wiki} for more details and tutorials.
